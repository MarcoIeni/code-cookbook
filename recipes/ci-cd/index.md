This are is about running automated tests and automated deploys using cloud services.

Sample configs and explanations are provided.

### Why use CI/CD to deploy and 

I highly recommend rather using a platform like Netlify or GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages to deploy your a static site. Such as for Jekyll site, or React or Vue SPA apps.

You will get free hosting, free automated deploys and there are no servers to manage (normally you would have to worry about security, performance and cost).

You get a URL like:

- `https://my-blog.netlify.app`
- `https://MichaelCurrin.github.io/my-blog/

If you own a custom domain like `https://myblog.com`, you can add on that up on top of your Netlify or GitHub Pages at no additional charge.
