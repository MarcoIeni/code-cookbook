## Limitations

[Intro to Github Actions blog post](https://gabrieltanner.org/blog/an-introduction-to-github-actions)

> Actions are completely free for every open-source repository and include **2000 free build minutes per month** for all your private repositories which is comparable with most CI/CD free plans. If that is not enough for your needs you can pick another plan or go the self-hosted route.
