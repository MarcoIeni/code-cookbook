## How to get started

For options and syntax around workflow files, see my [GitHub Actions][] cheatsheet guide.

Here are some places to start to get into workflow file samples.

- [Basic generic workflow][]
    - A sample which covers the minimum fields
- [Basic Node workflow][]
    - Simple sample of running a Node.js app pipeline.
- [Workflows][] section
    - See sample workflows across programming languages.
