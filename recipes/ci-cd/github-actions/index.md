# GitHub Actions


## How to get started

For options and syntax around workflow files, see my [GitHub Actions](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/ci-cd/github-actions/) cheatsheet guide.

Here are some places to start to get into workflow file samples.

- [Basic generic workflow](workflows/basic.md)
    - A sample which covers the minimum fields
- [Basic node workflow](workflows/node/basic.md)
    - Simple sample of running a Node.js app pipeline.
- [Workflows](workflows/) section
    - See sample workflows across programming languages.
