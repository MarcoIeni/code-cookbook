description: How to manage GitHub API tokens and deploy keys for use with GH Actions
---

The use-case here is if you want to change content and commit in a repo using GitHub Actions.

Maybe you want to pull in some CSV data and store it. Or you want to apply lint and formatting automatically.

Then you need to give your workflow permissions to push to your repo from within the Actions environment. So you must provide a token or use a deploy key.
