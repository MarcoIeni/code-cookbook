# Python

See [Building and testing Python](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/guides/building-and-testing-pythons) in the GH Actions docs.


## Notes

These recipes mostly use the [setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) action.

And are based on the [Using Python with GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions) guide on the GH docs.
