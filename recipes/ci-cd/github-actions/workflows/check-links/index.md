# Check links

Validate the local or external links on a site.

Then you can get a GH notification that your workflow failed and you can fix the links. You might want to have it stop your deploy, or not. You can also run the checks on a schedule such as weekly, so you check external links without having to do a depoy to trigger the workflow.

Some here focus on markdown docs in a repo, rather than on HTML files or on a built static site.
