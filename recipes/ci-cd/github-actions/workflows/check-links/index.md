title: Check links
description: Tools to validate the local and external links on a site.

You can get a GH notification that your workflow failed and you can fix the links. You might want to have it stop your deploy, or not. You can also run the checks on a schedule such as weekly, so you check external links without having to do a depoy to trigger the workflow.

Some action recipes here are intended for markdown files, while others will analyize the built site. Either way, this works great for a static site like Jekyll.
