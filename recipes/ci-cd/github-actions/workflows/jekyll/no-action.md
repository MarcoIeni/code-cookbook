# Simple Jekyll build
> Adding CI for Jekyll without actions and without publishing

Below is a workflow generated by the GitHub when it suggests a Jekyll workflow for your project. It uses a `docker run` step without using an aciton from the marketplace.

Note that this only **builds** a Jekyll site and does **not persist it** or deploy to GH Pages. That can be managed in a separate step, or use one of the marketplace actions which does that all in one. See [Deploy GH Pages](deploy-gh-pages/).

- `main.yml`
    ```yaml
    name: Jekyll site CI

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ master ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ master ]

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Build the site in the jekyll/builder container
            run: |
              docker run \
              -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/srv/jekyll -v ${{ github.workspace }}/_site:/srv/jekyll/_site \
              jekyll/builder:latest /bin/bash -c "chmod 777 /srv/jekyll && jekyll build --future"
    ```
