# Basic
> Jekyll CI flow without any specialized actions and without persisting or publishing


## Sample

Below is a workflow generated by the GitHub when it suggests a Jekyll workflow for your project. It uses a `docker run` step without using an aciton from the marketplace.

- `main.yml`
    ```yaml
    name: Jekyll site CI

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ master ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ master ]

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Build the site in the jekyll/builder container
            run: |
              docker run \
              -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/srv/jekyll -v ${{ github.workspace }}/_site:/srv/jekyll/_site \
              jekyll/builder:latest /bin/bash -c "chmod 777 /srv/jekyll && jekyll build --future"
    ```
    
    
## Persisting

Note that the sample this only **builds** a Jekyll site and does **not persist it** or deploy to GH Pages. 

That can be managed in a separate step - or use one of the marketplace actions which does that all in one. 

See cookbook pages:

- [GH Pages Actions](gh-pages-actions.md) doc in this Jekyll section
- [Deploy GH Pages](../deploy-gh-pages/) doc in a more generic section that can still be used for Jekyll
