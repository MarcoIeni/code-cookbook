# Jekyll in a container

{% raw %}

This flow runs a **Docker container**

It has with Ruby and Jekyll inside container which is run as a binary (using `docker` CLI but no `Dockerfile` needed). So it can be used as a drop-in replacement for running `jekyll` directly. Plus the container takes care of Ruby and Jekyll dependencies and installing project dependencies. I end the workflow by deploy the `_site` directory generated by the build step as a GH Pages site.

- `main.yml`
    ```yaml
    name: GH Pages deploy

    on:
      push:
        branches: main
        paths-ignore:
          - README.md

      pull_request:
        branches: main
        paths-ignore:
          - README.md

    jobs:
      build-deploy:
        name: Build and deploy

        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Build Jekyll site
            run: |
              docker run \
                -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/srv/jekyll \
                jekyll/builder:4 \
                /bin/bash -c 'chmod 777 /srv/jekyll && jekyll build --future'
                
          - name: Deploy to GH Pages üöÄ
            if: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
            uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
            with:
              github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              publish_dir: _site
    ```

See my Jekyll GH Actions Quickstart template project which demonstrates how to build a minimal site. It has a GH Actions flow which uses Docker + Jekyll in one step and GH Pages deploy in the last step.

## About the approach

This builds the site using a **Docker** container step. This means you don't need to use any Action from the marketplace to setup your Ruby and Jekyll environment. The container image is ready to go. When you run it, it will even install your gems for you using Bundler.

I think this is great - I don't know why there are so many Jekyll actions out there. Maybe if you really need control over the environment or build steps. Some actions include Jekyll and GH Pages in one - I don't think it is a good idea to mix those together in one inseparable step.

Another advantage is that you can run the exact same container locally - which is great for debugging and for running your application locally on any OS without requiring Ruby, Bundler and gems installed.

An advantage of using Docker here is that you can run the same command locally - no Ruby or Jekyll needed. You can move the full docker command to a `Makefile` too to make it easier to run as `make build`.

### Caching note

A disadvantage of using Docker here is that the image is not cached and so must be downloaded each time. I found an action which supports caching of Docker images, but adds extra steps and complexity. Maybe the plain cache action can work for Docker cache directory? 

Also, the gems have to be downloaded and installed each time, which be avoided by adding the cache action, even if it does't cache the image.


## Notes on the workflow

- Using the Docker step alone output would get thrown away after the build. If you want to persist as a GH Pages site, just add on the last section as below, using a generic GH Pages action.
- You can pick a tag like `4` to get a recent version in `4.x` range. I'd avoid `latest` as one day you'll suddenly get `5`. GH Pages normally limits you to `3.9`.
- The `--future` flag is to publish futured-dated posts.


## Original workflow

The workflow is based on the one generated by the GitHub when it suggests a Jekyll workflow for your project.

My changes:

- Use Jekyll version `4` instead of `latest`, to avoid upgrading to 5 by accident. Also, you can use `4.2` etc. if such as tag exists.
- Add GH Pages at the end to persist on `gh-pages` branch. I've also setup this deploy step only runs on the main branch, not feature branches.
- Remove a volume.

I tried to use `$PWD` instead of `${{ github.workspace }}` but got a permissions error. Just make sure to use `$PWD` for local use. i.e. `-v "$PWD:/srv/jekyll"`

See related notes below.

### Permissions note

Note use of `chmod 777`. Otherwise you get an error that `Gemfile.lock` is not writeable.

### Volume note

Note that GitHub's own starter workflow mounts **two** volumes, when only one is needed.

Here it is anyway with `_site` as a volume.

```
-v ${{ github.workspace }}:/srv/jekyll \
-v ${{ github.workspace }}/_site:/srv/jekyll/_site \
```

The second is unnecessary as it is already covered by the first as a nested directory with the identical name in and outside the container.
