### Resources

- [Github Actions CI](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/) - a tutorial I wrote for the Jekyll docs.
- [jekyll-actions-quickstart](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/jekyll-actions-quickstart/) project site of mine including resources


### Local config

If you need to set values in the environment locally, you could do this with an ignored `.env` file at the root. Youâ€™ll have to to load that into the shell. Some plugins will read from a `.env` file though.

In this case the only environment variable needed is one needed to actually run the action and build to gh-pages branch, so this project has no `.env` file.
