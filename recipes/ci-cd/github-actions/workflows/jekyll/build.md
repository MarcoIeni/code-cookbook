## Sample

### Generic docker flow

Below is a workflow based o nthe generated by the GitHub when it suggests a Jekyll workflow for your project. 

My additions:

- Rename step.
- Use Jekyll version `4` instead of `latest`.
- Use GH Pages at the end to persist on `gh-pages` branch. This deploy step only runs on the main branch.

This builds the site using a **Docker** container step. This means you don't need to use any Action from the marketplace to setup your Ruby and Jekyll environment. The container image is ready to go. When you run it, it will even install your gems for you using Bundler.

I think this is great - I don't know why there are so many Jekyll actions out there. Maybe if you really need control over the environment or build steps. Some actions include Jekyll and GH Pages in one - I don't think it is a good idea to mix those together in one inseparable step.

Another pro is that you can run the exact same container locally - which is great for debugging and for running your application locally on any OS without requiring Ruby, Bundler and gems installed.

Notes on the workflow:

- Using the Docker step alone output would get thrown away after the build. If you want to persist as a GH Pages site, just add on the last section as below, using a generic GH Pages action.
- You can pick a tag like `4` to get a recent version in `4.x` range. I'd avoid `latest` as one day you'll suddenly get `5`. GH Pages normally limits you to `3.9`.
- The `--future` flag is to publish futured-dated posts.

- `main.yml`
    ```yaml
    name: Jekyll site CI

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - master
      pull_request:
        branches:
          - master

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Build Jekyll site
            run: |
              docker run \
                -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/srv/jekyll \
                -v ${{ github.workspace }}/_site:/srv/jekyll/_site \
                jekyll/builder:4 \
                /bin/bash -c 'chmod 777 /srv/jekyll && jekyll build --future'

          - name: ðŸš€ Deploy
            if: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
            uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
            with:
              github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              publish_dir: _site
    ```


### Jekyll Action TS

- [![limjh16 - jekyll-action-ts](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=limjh16&message=jekyll-action-ts&color=blue&logo=github)](https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts)

This is fork of [Jekyll Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-actions) action, except this one doesn't seem to publish for you. Which is fine as it means this Jekyll action has a narrow scope and it is also easy to add an extra step to publish to GH Pages. The docs recommend a popular action by PeaceIris, as shown in the last step below.

It appears you have to first setup Ruby and then use this Jekyll-related action.

This uses TypeScript instead of Docker, so is supposed should be quicker to download than the original action. It also is more flexible to handle non-default use-cases.

Sample usage based on the docs.

- `main.yml`
    ```yaml
    name: Build and deploy

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - master

    jobs:
      jekyll:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: ðŸ“‚ Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: ðŸ’Ž Setup Ruby
            uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
            with:
              ruby-version: 2.7

          - name: ðŸ”¨ Install dependencies and build site
            uses: limjh16/jekyll-action-ts@v2
            with:
              enable_cache: true

          - name: ðŸš€ Deploy
            if: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
            uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
            with:
              github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              publish_dir: _site
    ```
