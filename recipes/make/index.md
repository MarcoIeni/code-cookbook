# Make

Make is a task runner which saves you having to remember and type long commands or sequences and also makes your flows easy to reproduce locally, on remote services and on other developers' machines.

Make originally came from C background but I find it is a great fit for Python and Jekyll projects. On Ruby you'll probably use [Rake](../rake/) and for Node projects you'll probably just use commands defined in the _scripts_ section of your NPM package file.

This section is for use in the shell of Linux and macOS distros. If you use Windows, you'll need to use a `makefile.bat` file instead that has different syntax.
