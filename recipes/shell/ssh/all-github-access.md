# Allow Github SSH access

Add your SSH key to Github so you can push with an SSH repo URL. This avoids having to enter your password each time your push or if you pull a private repo. And this is especially useful if 2FA is setup.


## Generate

Follow the [keys](keys.md) guide to generate a key.


## Add to Github

Login to Github account.

Go to settings.
