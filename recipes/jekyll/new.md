## Steps

1. Create a new empty repo.
1. Go to the _Settings_ of repo.
1. Go to the GitHub Pages section.
1. Choose your main branch and enable.
1. Choose a theme, using one of two approaches.
    - Use the GitHub UI - change theme on the current section of _Settings_. This will create a config  file and `README.md` file (warning: this will overwrite an existing `README.md`, which happened me).
    - Create a config file manually, then add theme as`theme: NAME` or `remote-theme: USER/NAME`.
1. Optionally create an `index.md` file.
