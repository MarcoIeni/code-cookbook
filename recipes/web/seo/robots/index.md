# Robots file


## About

A `/robots.txt` file your domain gives directives for SEO crawlers like GoogleBot on how to crawl your site. Crawlers can be requested to ignore the `/admin` path or the entire domain for example. Note that directives are suggestions and do not have to be obeyed by crawlers.
