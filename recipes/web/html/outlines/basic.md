The character encoding must appear as early as possible in `head`. You'll get a browser warning if you omit it.

- `index.html`
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

        <title>My Title</title>
        <meta name="description" content="My description">

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

    </head>

    <body>
        <script src="main.js" async defer></script>

    </body>

    </html>
    ```
