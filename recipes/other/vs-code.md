# VS Code


## Share settings

If you have VS Code and VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) installed but only want to manage one `settings.json` file:

### macOS

```sh
$ rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code\ -\ Insiders/User/settings.json
$ ln -s ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code\ -\ Insiders/User/settings.json
```
