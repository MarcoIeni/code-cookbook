# Super linter

A GitHub Action that lints across multiple languages.

See also [Super linter](/recipes/ci-cd/github-actions/workflows/linting/super-linter.md) in the GH workflows section of this project.

This is very verbose covering languages I don't use and also the markdown linting can be noisy or too strict when it is not my focus.

However, this action is a good working example of all the linters on GitHub Actions, so I can unbundle them.
