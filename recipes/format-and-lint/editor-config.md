# EditorConfig

See [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org/) for syntax.

The point of the editor config file is to set one in each repo so that when you or others edit in the repo in any coding environment that supports it, you'll get the same settings. 


## Support

The `.editorconfig` file will only be used by your editor if it supports it.

GitHub and PyCharm don't need an extension to support this.

For VS Code, you need an extension. I would highly recommend the [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) extension as it is popular and I find it useful.

### VS Code notes

Without using editor config, VS Code already lets you choose the indent level and tabs/spaces handling. You cannot set by file type though. It can infer from the current file, this can be annoying when creating a new JS file example and the indent level is set to 4 spaces until you override it or type it that way.

When you use an editor config file and an extension in VS Code, then you get to set the indentation for all new and existing files. This takes preference over the VS Code's inference.

For using the Prettier extension, see the VS Code section of the [Prettier]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link recipes/javascript/format-and-lint/prettier.md %}) page.


## File format

Here is what the general syntax is like for a `.editorconfig` file.

```ini
root = true

[*]
foo = bar

[*.foo]
foo = bar

[*.{buzz,bazz}]
foo = bar
```

Some like to put this at the top of the file before `root`.

```ini
# editorconfig.org
```


## Samples

These are separate but can combined if they make sense for one project.

### Own

I find this a good starting point for adding a file to a project and then refining it.

#### Python focused projects

It supports an explicit default of 4 spaces such as for Python or Markdown files and an override for JavaScript and JSON files.

```ini
root = true

[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

[*.{js,json]
indent_size = 2
```

#### JS-focused projects

If most of the project's scripts (shell, JS, TS) and configs (YAML and JSON) use 2 spaces, then it makes sense to use `2` as the default. And set exceptions for `.md`, `.html` and `.py`.

```ini
root = true

[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

[*.{md,html}]
indent_size = 4

[Makefile]
indent_style = tab
indent_size = 4
```

### Python

```ini
[*.py]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```

### Two spaces

If needed, also add this to the samples below.

```ini
indent_style = space
```

### Configs

```ini
[*.{json,yml}]
indent_size = 2
```

#### Shell

```ini
[*.sh]
indent_size = 2
```

#### JavaScript

```ini
[*.js]
indent_size = 2
```

```ini
[*.{js,ts}]
indent_size = 2
```

```ini
[*.{js,json}]
indent_size = 2
```

#### Ruby

```ini
[*.rb]
indent_size = 2
```

### Make

Without EditorConfig settings, VS Code knows that a `Makefile` must have tabs only (running a file with spaces gives an error).

But, if you use a `*` glob change it in your EditorConfig, then also need a section `Makefile`. The size is just for visibility in the IDE, not how it is stored.

```ini
[Makefile]
indent_size = 2
indent_style = tab
```

### Markdown

```ini
[*.md]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```

### HTML

```ini
[*]
charset = utf-8
indent_size = 4
indent_style = space
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
```

For Jekyll markdown support, add this. But only if you use the double space at the end of a line to signify a line break.

```ini
[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

### Generated

The VS Code EditorConfig extension can generate a file for you if you right-click on a file on a folder. It won't create one if one already exists. You could also create them them at multiple levels if you need to.

Here is output generated by the extension. Perhaps too verbose. Also I had to tweak the whitespace ones as below and VS Code does not honor those - it has its own IDE settings.

```ini
root = true

[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
```

### Generic

Some devs like to set this before going into more formats. I don't see it as needed. The final newline I handle in my global IDE settings, though other users might not.

```ini
[*]
charset = utf-8
insert_final_newline = true
```

### Demo

Based on the one on the EditorConfig homepage.

```ini
# EditorConfig is awesome: https://EditorConfig.org

# top-most EditorConfig file
root = true

# Unix-style newlines with a newline ending every file
[*]
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true

# Matches multiple files with brace expansion notation
# Set default charset
[*.{js,py}]
charset = utf-8

# 4 space indentation
[*.py]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

# Tab indentation (no size specified)
[Makefile]
indent_style = tab

# Indentation override for all JS under lib directory
[lib/**.js]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

# Matches the exact files either package.json or .travis.yml
[{package.json,.travis.yml}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
```
