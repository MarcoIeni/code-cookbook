description: Create moving visual stories with code

Scratch is friendly for kids and code beginners to get into coding and algorithms. As it focusses on visual inputs and outputs instead of typing code.

Also if you just want to be creative and tell stories or play with code.

## Samples

The code is visual blocks in the Scratch interface rather than text, so it won't translate well here.

But check the [Ideas](https://scratch.mit.edu/ideas) page for building things. They set up the space to run that idea online and they provide you with a video and a tutorial if you need help.
