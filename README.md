## About

A collection of answers to coding problems I come across, so I can refer back here to see what a few good approaches are.

Like a cheatsheet, but rather than one-line commands or code blocks, the answer is a longer file, a combination of files, or series of steps to follow.

Some answers will be boilerplate that you can copy to your project as is, with a few values possibly to configure.

Some content will be steps to follow in the command-line and not so much code to write.

The explanations are steps are more thorough than would fit in a cheatsheet. Though the emphasis is more on the content rather than steps to follow.

The solutions are based on my experienced or copied from other projects that I find, as a reference for how to something.

### Examples

- `robots.txt` file
- `sitemap.xml`
- Github Actions - choosing actions
