A collection of reusable code I have written or copied from other sources like tutorials or repos. I give credit as much as possible.

<!-- TODO simply and move to About section or new page.

Sometimes the "recipe" in a directory is a group of scripts and possibly configs which work together. 

Sometimes there is just a collection of ingredients which are similar and can be used in a larger recipe. For example, a collection of ESLint config files from various sources, or some boilerplate HTML and CSS to add an element to a Jekyll site.

I have a lot of template or "quickstart" repos on GitHub, but sometimes there are too specific for a larger setup. So this cookbook repo can take the most useful parts of those repos and put them in here as snippets with detail comments. This is a nice balance between entire files or projects which are not all relevant (or up to date) and giving one-line definitions of fields and allowed values.

A collection of answers to coding problems I come across, so I can refer back here to see what a few good approaches are.

Like a cheatsheet, but rather than one-line commands or code blocks, the answer is a longer file, a combination of files, or series of steps to follow.

Some answers will be boilerplate that you can copy to your project as is, with a few values possibly to configure.

Some content will be steps to follow in the command-line and not so much code to write.

The explanations are steps are more thorough than would fit in a cheatsheet and a cheatsheet would be more low-level pieces than a set of instructions. Though the emphasis is more on the content rather than steps to follow.

The solutions are based on my experienced or copied from other projects that I find, as a reference for how to something.

This project does not cover steps on install tools but rather how to use them.

This project is partly based on a principle in the book [Steal like an artist](https://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253) which recommends making a stash of things that resonate with you and you can use an inspiration. Whether music, pictures, code... Note the book discourages plagiarism but focuses on the idea that nothing is truthy original, so use pieces that you find and rework them and make them yours in something new. This Code Cookbook is my collection or stash, using links and credits as much as possible to repos and docs, so I can draw on trusted examples when I need a reference.
