## About

A collection of answers to coding problems I come across, so I can refer back here to see what a few good approaches are.

Like a cheatsheet, but rather than one-line commands or code blocks, the answer is a longer file or a combination of files. 

Some answers will be boilerplate that you can copy to your project as is, with a few values possibly to configure.

The explanations are steps are more thorough than would fit in a cheatsheet. Though the emphasis is more on the content rather than steps to follow.

The solutions are based on my experienced or copied from other projects that I find.

### Examples

- `robots.txt` file
- `sitemap.xml`
- Github Actions - choosing actions
