# Code Cookbook
> Recipes to follow to achieve small or large goals using scripts or configs

![Check markdown links](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/code-cookbook/workflows/Check%20markdown%20links/badge.svg)

A collection of reusable code I have written or copied from other sources like tutorials or repos. I give credit as much as possible.

Sometimes the "recipe" in a directory is a group of scripts and possibly configs which work together. 

Sometimes there is just a collection of ingredients which are similar and can be used in a larger recipe. For example, a collection of ESLint config files from various sources.


## About

A collection of answers to coding problems I come across, so I can refer back here to see what a few good approaches are.

Like a cheatsheet, but rather than one-line commands or code blocks, the answer is a longer file, a combination of files, or series of steps to follow.

Some answers will be boilerplate that you can copy to your project as is, with a few values possibly to configure.

Some content will be steps to follow in the command-line and not so much code to write.

The explanations are steps are more thorough than would fit in a cheatsheet. Though the emphasis is more on the content rather than steps to follow.

The solutions are based on my experienced or copied from other projects that I find, as a reference for how to something.

This project does not cover steps on install tools but rather how to use them.

### Examples

- `robots.txt` file
- `sitemap.xml`
- Github Actions - choosing actions
